# NanoCode
## Minimalistic, Open-source and Light-weight code editor made in Tauri.

![](https://i.ibb.co/YL1DWSs/image.png)

### Information:

This is a code editor made with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [JavaScript](https://javascript.com) and the [CodeMirror Library](https://codemirror.net/). 

It is actually my first ever project made with Tauri. ðŸŽ‰

The current version has only taken a couple of days to construct but I'm planning on making this a bigger project with better features.


### Download:

- Go to the [website](https://azedeveloper.github.io/NanoCode)
- Click the "Download" button.
- Download and Open the MSI file.
- Follow the install instructions.
- You now have NanoCode installed on your system! 

### Features:

- Open and Save files with CTRL + O and CTRL + S.
- Syntax Highlighting and a cool theme with the CodeMirror library.
- The app is only 8.5mb at the moment!


### Checklist:

NanoCode is not close to being finished yet, these are the stuff that I'm working on:

- [ ] LSP Support
- [ ] Custom Themes and a Theme Maker
- [ ] An in-built Terminal
- [ ] A File Explorer
- [ ] Better developer experience such as shortcuts and stuff.

You can always DM me on Discord if you have any ideas: **AzE#8373**.

NanoCode is and always will remain free of charge, but if you are willing to donate  you can do it on my paypal.me:
