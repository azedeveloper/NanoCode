### Features:

- Open and Save files with CTRL + O and CTRL + S.
- Syntax Highlighting with the CodeMirror library.
- The app is only 8.5mb at the moment!


### Not finished:

**NanoCode is not close to being finished yet ⚠️, I'm planning on adding a lot of stuff such as:**

- LSP Support
- Custom Themes and a Theme Maker
- An in-built Terminal
- A File Explorer
- Better developer experience such as shortcuts and stuff.

You can always DM me on Discord if you have any ideas: **AzE#8373**.
