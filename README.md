### Information:

This is a code editor made with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [JavaScript](https://javascript.com) and the [CodeMirror Library](https://codemirror.net/). üìù

I recommend checking out the [documentation](https://azedev.gitbook.io/nanocode) before using it! üìñ

It was made by [AzE](https://azedev.net/) (me), a Game and Web developer located in Gothenburg, Sweden. üìå

It is actually my first ever project made with Tauri. üéâ
