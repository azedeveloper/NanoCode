## Minimalistic, Open-source and Light-weight code editor made in Tauri.

This is just a very early beta build, it is only compatible for windows at the moment and probably has a lot of bugs.


### Features:

- Open and Save files with CTRL + O and CTRL + S.
- Syntax Highlighting with the CodeMirror library.
